Github repository for PAE HP
============================

Here the team will store all the code used in the project. The team is divided in three groups.


Gyro/Encoders
-------------

This group is in charge of extracting the data from the robot movements. All this data will be filtered to get a better result. All the code used by this group will be stored in the folder [Gyro_Encoders](https://github.com/LucasTakanori/PAE-HP/tree/main/Gyro_Encoders).

Kalman Filter
-------------

All the code used by this group will be stored in the folder [Kalman](https://github.com/LucasTakanori/PAE-HP/tree/main/Kalman).


Validation
----------

This group is in charge of validate the final result. Three different systems of validation have been thought. All the code used by this group will be stored in the folder [Validation](https://github.com/LucasTakanori/PAE-HP/tree/main/Validation).

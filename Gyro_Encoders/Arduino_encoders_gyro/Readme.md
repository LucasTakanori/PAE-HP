Since there was not enough time to redo all the Kalman code in c++, we decided to make a small python program, a data logger of the data provided by the Arduino, in order to use Kalman.

The structure of this directory is the following:

- Inside the folder [Arduino](https://github.com/LucasTakanori/PAE-HP/tree/main/Gyro_Encoders/Arduino_encoders_gyro/Arduino/ ) you will find all the programs and libraries used for the Arduino board.

- The program to store all the data comming from Arduino is the following [data_log.py](https://github.com/LucasTakanori/PAE-HP/tree/main/Gyro_Encoders/Arduino_encoders_gyro/data_log.py)
